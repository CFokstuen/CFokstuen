Greetings,

I can describe myself within the context of this platform as a current Master/post graduate student and a aspiring web developer.
I'm highly curious by nature, with a broad world view that comes from a high level of openness to experiences.
Forever seeking challenges, I am emrging myself to a broad range of languages; HTML, CSS, JS, and Python, specifically.
